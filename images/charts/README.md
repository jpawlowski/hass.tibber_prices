# Chart Screenshots

This directory contains screenshots of the different chart configurations available through `tibber_prices.get_apexcharts_yaml`.

## Files:

- ✅ `today.png` - Static view of today's prices (representative of all fixed day views)
- ✅ `rolling-window.png` - Dynamic 48h rolling window with Y-axis scaling
- ✅ `rolling-window-autozoom.png` - Auto-zoom view with progressive zoom

**Note:** Tomorrow view is visually identical to today view, so one static screenshot covers all fixed day modes (yesterday/today/tomorrow).

## Screenshot Guidelines:

When capturing screenshots:

1. Use a clean Home Assistant dashboard (no other cards visible)
2. Capture during a day with interesting price variations (show the chart at work!)
3. Include both light and dark mode versions if possible
4. Make sure best price period highlights are visible (if enabled)
5. Capture at a resolution that's readable when embedded in docs (at least 1200px width)

## Recommended for README.md:

Use `rolling_window.png` in the main README.md as it shows:
- ✅ Dynamic 48h window (impressive!)
- ✅ Color-coded series (visual appeal)
- ✅ Dynamic Y-axis scaling (key feature)
- ✅ Best price period highlights (useful overlay)
- ✅ Gradient effect (polished look)

This showcases the most advanced features at a glance!
