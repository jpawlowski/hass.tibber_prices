## Configuration Options

### Average Sensor Display Settings

**Location:** Settings → Devices & Services → Tibber Prices → Configure → Step 6

The integration allows you to choose how average price sensors display their values. This setting affects all average sensors (daily, 24h rolling, hourly smoothed, and future forecasts).

#### Display Modes

**Median (Default):**
- Shows the "middle value" when all prices are sorted
- **Resistant to extreme spikes** - one expensive hour doesn't skew the result
- Best for understanding **typical price levels**
- Example: "What was the typical price today?"

**Arithmetic Mean:**
- Shows the mathematical average of all prices
- **Includes effect of spikes** - reflects actual cost if consuming evenly
- Best for **cost calculations and budgeting**
- Example: "What was my average cost per kWh today?"

#### Why This Matters

Consider a day with these hourly prices:
```
10, 12, 13, 15, 80 ct/kWh
```

- **Median = 13 ct/kWh** ← "Typical" price (middle value, ignores spike)
- **Mean = 26 ct/kWh** ← Average cost (spike pulls it up)

The median tells you the price was **typically** around 13 ct/kWh (4 out of 5 hours). The mean tells you if you consumed evenly, your **average cost** was 26 ct/kWh.

#### Automation-Friendly Design

**Both values are always available as attributes**, regardless of your display choice:

```yaml
# These attributes work regardless of display setting:
{{ state_attr('sensor.tibber_home_average_price_today', 'price_median') }}
{{ state_attr('sensor.tibber_home_average_price_today', 'price_mean') }}
```

This means:
- ✅ You can change the display anytime without breaking automations
- ✅ Automations can use both values for different purposes
- ✅ No need to create template sensors for the "other" value

#### Affected Sensors

This setting applies to:
- Daily average sensors (today, tomorrow)
- 24-hour rolling averages (trailing, leading)
- Hourly smoothed prices (current hour, next hour)
- Future forecast sensors (next 1h, 2h, 3h, ... 12h)

See the **[Sensors Guide](sensors.md#average-price-sensors)** for detailed examples.

#### Choosing Your Display

**Choose Median if:**
- 👥 You show prices to users ("What's today like?")
- 📊 You want dashboard values that represent typical conditions
- 🎯 You compare price levels across days
- 🔍 You analyze volatility (comparing typical vs extremes)

**Choose Mean if:**
- 💰 You calculate costs and budgets
- 📈 You forecast energy expenses
- 🧮 You need mathematical accuracy for financial planning
- 📊 You track actual average costs over time

**Pro Tip:** Most users prefer **Median** for displays (more intuitive), but use `price_mean` attribute in cost calculation automations.
