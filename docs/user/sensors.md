## Binary Sensors

### Best Price Period & Peak Price Period

These binary sensors indicate when you're in a detected best or peak price period. See the **[Period Calculation Guide](period-calculation.md)** for a detailed explanation of how these periods are calculated and configured.

**Quick overview:**
- **Best Price Period**: Turns ON during periods with significantly lower prices than the daily average
- **Peak Price Period**: Turns ON during periods with significantly higher prices than the daily average

Both sensors include rich attributes with period details, intervals, relaxation status, and more.
