Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Tibber Prices**\n3. Click on your home → Find **'Chart Data Export'** in the **Diagnostic** section\n4. Enable the sensor - it will automatically call the service with your configuration\n5. Use the sensor's attributes in your dashboard cards\n\n**Configuration guide:**\n1. Test your service call in **Developer Tools → Services → `tibber_prices.get_chartdata`**\n2. Copy the YAML from the `data:` section (without `entry_id`)\n3. Paste it below (use **Shift+Enter** or **Ctrl+Enter** for new lines, NOT just Enter)\n\n**Example YAML:**\n```yaml\nday:\n  - today\n  - tomorrow\ninclude_level: true\ninclude_rating_level: true\n```\n\n**Note:** Leave empty to use service defaults or skip this feature if you don't need the sensor.",
