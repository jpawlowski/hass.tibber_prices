get_price:
  name: Get Tibber Price Info
  description: >-
    Returns merged priceInfo and priceRating for the requested day and config entry. Optionally, you can simulate the response as if it were a specific time-of-day (time, format HH:mm or HH:mm:ss), which only affects the previous/current/next fields, not the prices list. The simulated time is always combined with the selected day.
